# FizzBuzz

Count from 1 to a user selected number, replacing multiples of 3 and 5 with certain words.

## Motivation

This was created in response to a challenge problem in an online Thinkful course.

## Features

The expected user workflow is:

* A person visits the page and is prompted to enter a number.

* The numbers 1 to the user selected number are logged to the console and displayed on the page. All multiples of 3 are replaced with the word "Fizz", while all multiples of 5 are replaced with the word "Buzz". If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it is replaced with "FizzBuzz".

* The user selected number must be a positive, whole number.
